<p><strong>Chapter 13: Regular Expressions</strong></p>

<p>Regular expressions, commonly referred to as regex, are a powerful tool used for searching, validating, and manipulating text patterns. They are a fundamental concept in programming and are widely used in various programming languages, including Python, Java, and JavaScript.</p>

<p><strong>What are Regular Expressions?</strong></p>

<p>Regular expressions are a way to describe a search pattern using a sequence of characters. They can be used to match, replace, or extract specific patterns from a string of text. A regular expression consists of a combination of literal characters, special characters, and quantifiers that define the pattern to be matched.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Concepts</strong></p>

<p>Before diving into the world of regular expressions, it's essential to understand some basic concepts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Literal Characters</strong>: These are the actual characters that you want to match, such as letters, numbers, or special characters.</li>
<li><strong>Special Characters</strong>: These are characters that have a special meaning in regular expressions, such as <code>.</code> (dot), <code>*</code> (star), or <code>+</code> (plus).</li>
<li><strong>Quantifiers</strong>: These are used to specify the number of times a pattern should be matched, such as <code>*</code> (zero or more), <code>+</code> (one or more), or <code>?</code> (zero or one).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Common Special Characters</strong></p>

<p>Here are some common special characters used in regular expressions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>.</code> (dot): Matches any single character except a newline.</li>
<li><code>^</code> (caret): Matches the start of a string.</li>
<li><code>$</code> (dollar sign): Matches the end of a string.</li>
<li><code>*</code> (star): Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding pattern.</li>
<li><code>+</code> (plus): Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding pattern.</li>
<li><code>?</code> (question mark): Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding pattern.</li>
<li><code>{n}</code> (curly brackets): Matches exactly <code>n</code> occurrences of the preceding pattern.</li>
<li><code>{n, m}</code> (curly brackets with comma): Matches at least <code>n</code> but no more than <code>m</code> occurrences of the preceding pattern.</li>
<li><code>[abc]</code> (square brackets): Matches any character inside the brackets.</li>
<li><code>[^abc]</code> (square brackets with caret): Matches any character not inside the brackets.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples of Regular Expressions</strong></p>

<p>Here are some examples of regular expressions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>hello</code>: Matches the string "hello".</li>
<li><code>^hello</code>: Matches the string "hello" at the start of a line.</li>
<li><code>hello$</code>: Matches the string "hello" at the end of a line.</li>
<li><code>h.*o</code>: Matches any string that starts with "h" and ends with "o".</li>
<li><code>[a-zA-Z]</code>: Matches any letter (both uppercase and lowercase).</li>
<li><code>\d</code>: Matches any digit.</li>
<li><code>\w</code>: Matches any word character (letter, digit, or underscore).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Using Regular Expressions in Programming</strong></p>

<p>Regular expressions are widely used in programming languages to perform various tasks, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: Regular expressions can be used to validate user input, such as email addresses or phone numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Searching</strong>: Regular expressions can be used to search for specific patterns in a string of text.</li>
<li><strong>Replacing</strong>: Regular expressions can be used to replace specific patterns in a string of text.</li>
<li><strong>Extracting</strong>: Regular expressions can be used to extract specific patterns from a string of text.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Real-World Applications</strong></p>

<p>Regular expressions have numerous real-world applications, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Text Processing</strong>: Regular expressions are widely used in text processing applications, such as text editors and word processors.</li>
<li><strong>Data Validation</strong>: Regular expressions are used to validate user input in web applications and mobile apps.</li>
<li><strong>Log Analysis</strong>: Regular expressions are used to analyze log files and extract specific patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Network Security</strong>: Regular expressions are used to detect and prevent security threats, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Regular expressions are a powerful tool used for searching, validating, and manipulating text patterns. They are a fundamental concept in programming and are widely used in various programming languages. In this chapter, we have covered the basics of regular expressions, including literal characters, special characters, and quantifiers. We have also explored common special characters, examples of regular expressions, and real-world applications of regular expressions. With this knowledge, you can start using regular expressions in your programming projects and take your text processing skills to the next level.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Write a regular expression to match any string that starts with "hello" and ends with "world".</li>
<li>Write a regular expression to match any email address that contains the string "@example.com".</li>
<li>Write a regular expression to match any phone number that starts with "123" and has exactly 10 digits.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Answers</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><code>^hello.*world$</code></li>
<li><code>.*@example\.com</code></li>
<li><code>^123\d{8}$</code></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Chapter 1: B.1 Basic Syntax</strong></p>

<p>In this chapter, we will delve into the fundamental syntax of a programming language, focusing on the basic elements that form the building blocks of any program. Understanding the basic syntax is crucial for writing efficient, readable, and maintainable code.</p>

<p><strong>1.1 Identifiers</strong></p>

<p>Identifiers are the names given to variables, functions, and other program elements. They are used to distinguish one element from another and are a fundamental part of the syntax. In most programming languages, identifiers can be composed of letters, digits, and underscores, but cannot start with a digit.</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Example of valid identifiers</h1>

<p>name = "John"
age = 25
is_admin = True</p>

<h1>Example of invalid identifiers</h1>

<p>1name = "John"  # Invalid because it starts with a digit
_name = "John"  # Valid
```</p>

<p><strong>1.2 Variables</strong></p>

<p>Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program. They are declared using the assignment operator (=) and can be assigned a value of any data type. In most programming languages, variables must be declared before they are used.</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Example of declaring and assigning a variable</h1>

<p>x = 5  # Declare and assign an integer variable
y = "Hello"  # Declare and assign a string variable</p>

<h1>Example of using variables</h1>

<p>print(x + 3)  # Output: 8
print(y + " World")  # Output: Hello World
```</p>

<p><strong>1.3 Data Types</strong></p>

<p>Data types determine the type of value a variable can hold. Common data types include integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans. Understanding the different data types is essential for writing efficient and effective code.</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Example of different data types</h1>

<p>x = 5  # Integer
y = 3.14  # Floating-point number
z = "Hello"  # String
is_admin = True  # Boolean
```</p>

<p><strong>1.4 Operators</strong></p>

<p>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Common operators include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, &lt;, &gt;), and logical operators (&amp;&amp;, ||).</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Example of using operators</h1>

<p>x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)  # Output: 8
print(x &gt; y)  # Output: True
print(x == y)  # Output: False
```</p>

<p><strong>1.5 Control Structures</strong></p>

<p>Control structures determine the flow of a program's execution. Common control structures include if-else statements, for loops, and while loops.</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Example of using if-else statements</h1>

<p>x = 5
if x &gt; 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")</p>

<h1>Example of using for loops</h1>

<p>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)</p>

<h1>Example of using while loops</h1>

<p>x = 0
while x &lt; 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
```</p>

<p>In conclusion, understanding the basic syntax of a programming language is essential for writing efficient, readable, and maintainable code. By mastering the concepts of identifiers, variables, data types, operators, and control structures, you will be well on your way to becoming a proficient programmer.</p>

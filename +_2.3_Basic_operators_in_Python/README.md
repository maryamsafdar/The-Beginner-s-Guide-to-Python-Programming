<p><strong>Chapter 2.3: Basic Operators in Python</strong></p>

<p>In this chapter, we will explore the basic operators in Python, which are used to perform various operations such as arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and membership operations.</p>

<h3>2.3.1 Arithmetic Operators</h3>

<p>Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.</p>

<p>| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <code>+</code> | Addition | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a + b)</code> |
| <code>-</code> | Subtraction | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a - b)</code> |
| <code>*</code> | Multiplication | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a * b)</code> |
| <code>/</code> | Division | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a / b)</code> |
| <code>//</code> | Floor Division | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a // b)</code> |
| <code>%</code> | Modulus | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a % b)</code> |
| <code>**</code> | Exponentiation | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a ** b)</code> |</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Example usage of arithmetic operators</h1>

<p>a = 5
b = 3</p>

<p>print("Addition:", a + b)
print("Subtraction:", a - b)
print("Multiplication:", a * b)
print("Division:", a / b)
print("Floor Division:", a // b)
print("Modulus:", a % b)
print("Exponentiation:", a ** b)
```</p>

<h3>2.3.2 Comparison Operators</h3>

<p>Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result.</p>

<p>| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <code>==</code> | Equal to | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a == b)</code> |
| <code>!=</code> | Not equal to | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a != b)</code> |
| <code>&gt;</code> | Greater than | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a &gt; b)</code> |
| <code>&lt;</code> | Less than | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a &lt; b)</code> |
| <code>&gt;=</code> | Greater than or equal to | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a &gt;= b)</code> |
| <code>&lt;=</code> | Less than or equal to | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a &lt;= b)</code> |</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Example usage of comparison operators</h1>

<p>a = 5
b = 3</p>

<p>print("Equal to:", a == b)
print("Not equal to:", a != b)
print("Greater than:", a &gt; b)
print("Less than:", a &lt; b)
print("Greater than or equal to:", a &gt;= b)
print("Less than or equal to:", a &lt;= b)
```</p>

<h3>2.3.3 Logical Operators</h3>

<p>Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and return a boolean result.</p>

<p>| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <code>and</code> | Logical and | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a &gt; 4 and b &lt; 4)</code> |
| <code>or</code> | Logical or | <code>a = 5; b = 3; print(a &gt; 4 or b &lt; 4)</code> |
| <code>not</code> | Logical not | <code>a = 5; print(not a &gt; 4)</code> |</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Example usage of logical operators</h1>

<p>a = 5
b = 3</p>

<p>print("Logical and:", a &gt; 4 and b &lt; 4)
print("Logical or:", a &gt; 4 or b &lt; 4)
print("Logical not:", not a &gt; 4)
```</p>

<h3>2.3.4 Assignment Operators</h3>

<p>Assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable.</p>

<p>| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <code>=</code> | Simple assignment | <code>a = 5</code> |
| <code>+=</code> | Addition assignment | <code>a = 5; a += 3</code> |
| <code>-=</code> | Subtraction assignment | <code>a = 5; a -= 3</code> |
| <code>*=</code> | Multiplication assignment | <code>a = 5; a *= 3</code> |
| <code>/=</code> | Division assignment | <code>a = 5; a /= 3</code> |
| <code>//=</code> | Floor division assignment | <code>a = 5; a //= 3</code> |
| <code>%=</code> | Modulus assignment | <code>a = 5; a %= 3</code> |
| <code>**=</code> | Exponentiation assignment | <code>a = 5; a **= 3</code> |</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Example usage of assignment operators</h1>

<p>a = 5</p>

<p>print("Simple assignment:", a = 5)
print("Addition assignment:", a += 3)
print("Subtraction assignment:", a -= 3)
print("Multiplication assignment:", a <em>= 3)
print("Division assignment:", a /= 3)
print("Floor division assignment:", a //= 3)
print("Modulus assignment:", a %= 3)
print("Exponentiation assignment:", a *</em>= 3)
```</p>

<h3>2.3.5 Membership Operators</h3>

<p>Membership operators are used to check if a value is present in a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string).</p>

<p>| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <code>in</code> | Membership | <code>a = [1, 2, 3]; print(2 in a)</code> |
| <code>not in</code> | Non-membership | <code>a = [1, 2, 3]; print(4 not in a)</code> |</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Example usage of membership operators</h1>

<p>a = [1, 2, 3]</p>

<p>print("Membership:", 2 in a)
print("Non-membership:", 4 not in a)
```</p>

<p>In this chapter, we have covered the basic operators in Python, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and membership operators. These operators are essential for performing various operations in Python programming.</p>

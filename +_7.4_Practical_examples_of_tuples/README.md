<p><strong>Chapter 7.4: Practical Examples of Tuples</strong></p>

<p>In the previous chapters, we have discussed the basics of tuples, their creation, indexing, slicing, and various operations that can be performed on them. In this chapter, we will explore some practical examples of tuples and their applications in real-world scenarios.</p>

<h3>Example 1: Using Tuples to Represent a Person's Details</h3>

<p>Tuples can be used to represent a person's details such as name, age, address, and contact number. Here's an example:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Define a tuple to represent a person's details</h1>

<p>person_details = ("John Doe", 30, "123 Main St", "1234567890")</p>

<h1>Access individual elements of the tuple</h1>

<p>print("Name:", person<em>details[0])
print("Age:", person</em>details[1])
print("Address:", person<em>details[2])
print("Contact Number:", person</em>details[3])
```</p>

<h3>Example 2: Using Tuples to Represent a Product's Details</h3>

<p>Tuples can be used to represent a product's details such as product name, price, quantity, and category. Here's an example:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Define a tuple to represent a product's details</h1>

<p>product_details = ("Apple iPhone", 999.99, 10, "Electronics")</p>

<h1>Access individual elements of the tuple</h1>

<p>print("Product Name:", product<em>details[0])
print("Price:", product</em>details[1])
print("Quantity:", product<em>details[2])
print("Category:", product</em>details[3])
```</p>

<h3>Example 3: Using Tuples to Represent a Student's Grades</h3>

<p>Tuples can be used to represent a student's grades such as subject names, grades, and percentage. Here's an example:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Define a tuple to represent a student's grades</h1>

<p>student_grades = (("Math", 85), ("Science", 90), ("English", 78))</p>

<h1>Access individual elements of the tuple</h1>

<p>for subject, grade in student_grades:
    print(f"Subject: {subject}, Grade: {grade}")
```</p>

<h3>Example 4: Using Tuples to Represent a Company's Employees</h3>

<p>Tuples can be used to represent a company's employees such as employee names, job titles, and salaries. Here's an example:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Define a tuple to represent a company's employees</h1>

<p>employees = (("John Doe", "Software Engineer", 100000), ("Jane Doe", "Marketing Manager", 80000))</p>

<h1>Access individual elements of the tuple</h1>

<p>for employee in employees:
    print(f"Name: {employee[0]}, Job Title: {employee[1]}, Salary: {employee[2]}")
```</p>

<h3>Example 5: Using Tuples to Represent a Bank Account's Details</h3>

<p>Tuples can be used to represent a bank account's details such as account number, account holder's name, balance, and account type. Here's an example:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Define a tuple to represent a bank account's details</h1>

<p>account_details = ("1234567890", "John Doe", 1000.00, "Savings")</p>

<h1>Access individual elements of the tuple</h1>

<p>print("Account Number:", account<em>details[0])
print("Account Holder's Name:", account</em>details[1])
print("Balance:", account<em>details[2])
print("Account Type:", account</em>details[3])
```</p>

<h3>Example 6: Using Tuples to Represent a Weather Forecast</h3>

<p>Tuples can be used to represent a weather forecast such as date, temperature, humidity, and weather condition. Here's an example:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Define a tuple to represent a weather forecast</h1>

<p>weather_forecast = ("2022-01-01", 25, 60, "Sunny")</p>

<h1>Access individual elements of the tuple</h1>

<p>print("Date:", weather<em>forecast[0])
print("Temperature:", weather</em>forecast[1])
print("Humidity:", weather<em>forecast[2])
print("Weather Condition:", weather</em>forecast[3])
```</p>

<h3>Example 7: Using Tuples to Represent a Game's High Scores</h3>

<p>Tuples can be used to represent a game's high scores such as player names, scores, and levels. Here's an example:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>Define a tuple to represent a game's high scores</h1>

<p>high_scores = (("John Doe", 1000), ("Jane Doe", 800), ("Bob Smith", 600))</p>

<h1>Access individual elements of the tuple</h1>

<p>for player, score in high_scores:
    print(f"Player: {player}, Score: {score}")
```</p>

<p>In this chapter, we have seen various practical examples of tuples and their applications in real-world scenarios. Tuples can be used to represent a wide range of data structures such as person's details, product's details, student's grades, company's employees, bank account's details, weather forecast, and game's high scores.</p>
